## Data Schema

The data base consists of the following:

* `matches`: contains information about each match, including the date, teams, score, and attendance.
* `teams`: contains information about each team, including their name, country, and coach.
* `coaches`: contains information about each coach, including their name, team, and win percentage.

Why I choose the dataset and questions above,

I chose the dataset for my first project to be something that I am passionate about, soccer, which makes understanding the data easier and makes it easier to finish the project without boredom. When selecting the questions to answer, I wanted to choose ones that would not only showcase my skills but also provide valuable insights into the world of soccer. By analyzing the average attendance per match, the most common formation used by teams, and the coach with the highest win percentage, I aimed to demonstrate my ability to extract meaningful information from the data and present it clearly and concisely.
These questions also allowed me to apply various data analysis techniques, such as data filtering, grouping, and visualization, which helped me to develop my skills in working with datasets. Additionally, by exploring the relationships between different variables, such as team performance, coach experience, and player statistics, I gained a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to success in the European Football Championship.
